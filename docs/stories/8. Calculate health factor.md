# Calculate and display health factor ratio

## Description

`I want to calculate and display 'healthFactorValue' inside 'health-factor-summary' section based on the 'collateralValue'; 'totalBorrowed' value and liquidationThreshold' value ratio`

## Acceptance criterion
- The `healthfactorValue` formula is: `(Collateral usd Value Ã— Liquidation Threshold) / Total usd Borrowed`
- When `collateralValue` and `totalBorrowed` value is displayed inside `token-input-section` the `healthFactorValue` can be calculated and should be display inside the toolTip component from `health-factor-summary`
- The `liquidatonThreshold` depend on the collateral selected from `collateral-section` and mentionned inside `aave-parameter.json` and `aave-parameter.ts`
- The `healthFactorValue` should be updated each time `collateralValue`; `totalBorrowed` or `liquidationThreshold` value change
- The `healthFactorValue` should be updated each time `tokenSelected` change
  - For example, switching from WETH to DAI should result in a slightly different healthFactorValue due to their different Liquidation Threshold values
- When `collateralValue` or `debtValue` = 0 is not possible to calculate the `healthFactorValue`
- No formula value should be harcoded to calculate the `healthFactorValue`
- The web application preview should run without errors at the end of the story implementation
