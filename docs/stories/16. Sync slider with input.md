# Sync slider behavior with input value

## Description

`I want slider position to be controlled by the tokenQuantity and tokenPrice input onChange event`

## Acceptance criterion
- The slider to modify are for `tokenQuantity` and `tokenPrice`
- The new behavior for the slider is:
  - the value mapping is 1:1 between slider value and tokenQuantity and tokenPrice
  - the input field and slider interaction should changes in on immediately reflect in the other
- The slider should still be able to update value in tokenQuantity and tokenPrice as well
- Modify `tokenPrice` default value to {0}
- The existing business logic of the application should be intact at the end of this story implementation.
