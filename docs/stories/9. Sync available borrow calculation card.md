# Create available to borrow calculation and sync with health factor summary card

## Description

'I want to display the available to borrow value inside 'health-factor-summary' card and update in real-time
`I want to display the value of 'usdValue' input from 'Debt-section' to 'Total Borrowed' from 'health-factor-summary' section and updated in real-time so that Total Borrowed card always reflects the current value of 'usdValue'`

## Acceptance Criterion






- Logic of 'Available to Borrow' card from the 'healthfactor section':
  - Definition: The maximum amount a user can borrow without exceeding the Max LTV or risking liquidation.
  - Formula: `Available to Borrow = (Collateral Value × Max LTV) - Total Borrowed`
  - Example: If Collateral Value = 2,100, MaxLTV = 902,100, MaxLTV =901,050,  the Available to Borrow = (2,100×0.90)−2,100×0.90)−1,050 = 1,890−1,890−1,050 = $840.
