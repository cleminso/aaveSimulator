# Create available to borrow calculation and sync with health factor summary card

## Description

'I want to display the value `availableToBorrow` inside `health-factor-summary` section and update the value real-time so that `availableToBorrow` card always reflect the ratio between `collateralValue` and `totalBorrowed`

## Acceptance Criterion
- Create a





- Logic of 'Available to Borrow' card from the 'healthfactor section':
  - Definition: The maximum amount a user can borrow without exceeding the Max LTV or risking liquidation.
  - Formula: `Available to Borrow = (Collateral Value × Max LTV) - Total Borrowed`
  - Example: If Collateral Value = 2,100, MaxLTV = 902,100, MaxLTV =901,050,  the Available to Borrow = (2,100×0.90)−2,100×0.90)−1,050 = 1,890−1,890−1,050 = $840.
