# Calculate current LTV value.md

## Description

`I want to calculate and display 'currentLTV' value inside the 'health-factor'summary' section based on the 'Total Borrowed' and 'Collateral Value'`

## Acceptance Criterion
- The `currentLTV` formula is:`(Total Borrowed / Collateral Value) Ã— 100`
- The `currentLTV` value should be calculated only when `Total Borrowed` and `Collateral Value` are available
- The `currentLTV` should be updated each time `Total Borrowed` or `Collateral Value` change
- The `currentLTV` value is displayed inside `Current LTV / Max LTV` card from `health-factor-summary`
- The function `getCurrentLTV` is added to `currency.ts`
- When collateral `currencyQuantity` or debt `currencyQuantity` = 0 is not possible to calculate the `currentLTV` and `--` should be displayed
- No value should be harcoded to calculate the `currentLTV`
- The web application preview should run without errors at the end of the story implementation
