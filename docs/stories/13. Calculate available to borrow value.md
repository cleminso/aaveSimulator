# Calculate available to borrow value

## Description

`I want to calculate and display 'availableToBorrow' value inside the 'health-factor-summary' based on the 'Collateral Value' 'maxLTV' 'Total Borrowed'.`

## Acceptance criterion
- The `availableToBorrow` value formula is: `Collateral Value Ã— Max LTV) - Total Borrowed`
- The `availableToBorrow` should be calculated only when:
  - the `Collateral Value` and `Total Borrowed` are available
  - the `collateralCurrency` is selected, that it's possible to get `maxLTV`
- The `availableToBorrow` display in `cardContent` of `AvailableToBorrow` card from `health-factor-section`
  - The `availableToBorrow` is display after the sign (`$`)
- The function `getAvailableToBorrow` is added to `currency.ts`
- When `Collateral Value` or `Total Borrowed` value = 0 is not possible to calculate `availableToBorrow`
  - In this case, the `cardContent` display `$0.00`
- No value should be harcoded to calculate the `availableToBorrow`
- The web application preview should run without errors at the end of the story implementation
