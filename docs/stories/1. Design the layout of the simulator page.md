# Design the layout of the simulator page.

## Acceptance Criterions

Only create the layout structure of the simulator page.

This story is considered done when all of the following can be verified:
- sidePanel is 48px width when collapsed
- sidePanel is 220px width when extended
- topBar and mainContent sections are vertically aligned on the left side
- The vertical space between topBar and mainContent is 24px
- horizontal space between sidePanel and (topBar + mainContent, which are aligned on their left side) is 24px
- topBar uses the entire screen space on its right side, height is fixed at 40px
- mainContent space fills the screen on its right side and hugs its content vertically (height)

## TODO

- [ ] Create a `SidePanel` component using `shadcn/components`.
    - [ ] Implement collapsed state with a width of `48px`.
    - [ ] Implement extended state with a width of `220px`.
    - [ ] Ensure smooth transition between collapsed and extended states.
- [ ] Create a `TopBar` component using `shadcn/components`.
    - [ ] Set fixed height to `40px`.
    - [ ] Ensure it occupies the full width of the screen to the right of the `SidePanel`.
    - [ ] Vertically align it with the `MainContent` on the left side.
- [ ] Create a `MainContent` component.
    - [ ] Ensure it fills the screen width to the right of the `SidePanel`.
    - [ ] Ensure it hugs its content vertically (auto height).
    - [ ] Vertically align it with the `TopBar` on the left side.
- [ ] In `App.tsx`, structure the layout using these components: `SidePanel`, `TopBar`, and `MainContent`.
    - [ ] Place `SidePanel` on the left side.
    - [ ] Place `TopBar` and `MainContent` to the right of the `SidePanel`, stacked vertically.
    - [ ] Add horizontal spacing of `24px` between `SidePanel` and the combined `TopBar` and `MainContent` area.
    - [ ] Add vertical spacing of `24px` between `TopBar` and `MainContent`.
- [ ] Verify the layout against the acceptance criteria:
    - [ ] `sidePanel` is `48px` width when collapsed.
    - [ ] `sidePanel` is `220px` width when extended.
    - [ ] `topBar` and `mainContent` sections are vertically aligned on the left side.
    - [ ] Vertical space between `topBar` and `mainContent` is `24px`.
    - [ ] Horizontal space between `sidePanel` and (`topBar` + `mainContent`) is `24px`.
    - [ ] `topBar` uses the entire screen space on its right side, height is fixed at `40px`.
    - [ ] `mainContent` space fills the screen on its right side and hugs its content vertically (height).
