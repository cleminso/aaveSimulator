# Design the layout of collateral and debt section

## Acceptance criterions

- The collateral section contain 3 components:
  - a 'currencySelector' component, each on its own row
  - a 'tokenState' component, that contains 2 rows:
    - a first row with 'tokenQuantity' ShadCN number input labelled "{CURRENCY} Quantity" with a second 'usdValue' disabled number (currency, $) value labelled "USD Value"
    - a second row with ShadCN 'slider' component taking the whole width, separated from the first row by 12px, default slider settings should be between 0 and 20000, with increments of 1
  - a 'tokenSimulation' component that contains 2 rows:
    - a ShadCN 'tokenPrice' number (currency, USD) input, labelled "{CURRENCY} Price (USD)"
    - a ShadCN 'slider' component, separated from the first row by 12px, default slider settings should be between 0 and 20000, with increments of 1
- Note that in each instance, `{CURRENCY}` refers to the currency selected in the Currency Selector component
- When the 'tokenState' slider moves, the tokenQuantity should change accordingly, and the USD value should be tokenQuantity * Number(tokenPrice)
- When the 'tokenPrice' slider moves, the USD value should update similarly
- CREATE the same section structure for debt section
