# Calculate liquidation threshold price

## Description

`I want to calculate and display 'liquidationThresholdPrice' inside the 'health-factor-summary' based on 'Total Borrowed' 'Total Collateral Amount' 'Liquidation Threshold.`

## Acceptance criterion
- The `liquidationThresholdPrice` is: `Total Borrowed / (Total Collateral Amount * Liquidation Threshold)`
- The `liquidationThresholdPrice` should be calculated only when:
  - the `Total borrowed` value and `Total Collateral` quantity are available
  - the collateral currency is selected that it's possible to get `Liquidation threshold` value
- The `liquidationThresholdPrice` is display in `cardContent` of `LiquidationThresholdPrice` card from `health-factor-summary`
  - The `liquidationThresholdPrice` is display after the sign (`$`)
- The function `getLiquidationThresholdPrice` is added to `currency.ts`
- When `Total Borrowed` value or `Total Collateral` quantity = 0 is not possible to calculate the `liquidationthresholdPrice`
  - In this case, the card content display `$0.00`
- No value should be hardcoded to calculate the `liquidationThresholdPrice`
- The web application preview should run without errors at the end of the story implementation
