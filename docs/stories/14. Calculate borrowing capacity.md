# Calculate borrowing capacity value

## Description

`I want to calculate and display 'borrowingCapacity' value inside the 'health-factor-summary' based on the 'Collateral Value' 'maxLTV' and 'Available To Borrow'`

## Acceptance criterion
- The `borrowingCapacity` formula is: `Available to Borrow / (Collateral Value × Max LTV) × 100`
- The `borrowingCapacity` should be calculated only when:
  - the `Collateral Value` and `Available To Borrow` are available
  - the `collateralCurrency` is selected, that it's possible to get `maxLTV`
- The `borrowingCapacity` is display in `cardContent` of `Borrowing capacity` card from `health-factor-summary`
  - the `borrowingCapacity` is display before the sign (`%`)
- The function `getBorrowingCapacity` is added to `currency.ts`
- When `Collateral value` or `Available To Borrow` value = 0 is not possible to calculate `borrowingCapacity`
  - In this case, the `cardContent` display 0.00%
- No value should be hardcoded to calculate the `borrowingCapacity`
- The web application preview should run without errors at the end of the story implementation
